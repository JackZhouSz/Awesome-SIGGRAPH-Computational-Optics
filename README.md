# Awesome-SIGGRAPH-Computational-Imaging
A collection of computational imaging liteature presented on SIGGRAPH.

## Author's note
A good way to master the taste and progress of an area is to read its past high-impact papers. 
As a high-profile venue, SIGGRAPH has been publishing top-tier computational imaging paper for decades. However, as computational imaging is a realitively minor area in SIGGRAPH, every year there are only very few (less than 5) computational imaging papers published on SIGGRAPH while the topic and content of computational imaging related papers are a bit different from the rest of SIGGRAPH papers. As a consequence, it is not easy to keep track of the past computational papers. The author gets inspiration from [Krita](https://github.com/tkuri) and many others and creates this colection to help the community. The author also thanks [Ken-sen](https://kesen.realtimerendering.com/) for sharing the SIGGRAPH collection, which facilites the creation of this collection.
