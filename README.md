# Awesome-SIGGRAPH-Computational-Imaging
A collection of computational imaging liteature presented on SIGGRAPH.

Author's note: A good way to get the taste and progress of an area is to read its high-impact papers in the past. 
As a high-profile venue, SIGGAPH has been publishing top-tier computational imaging paper for decades. However, every year there are very few computational imaging related paper published on SIGGRAPH while the style and structure of computational imaging papers are a little bit different from the rest of SIGGRAPH papers. Hence it is hard to track the past computational papers. The author got inspiration from Krita and many others and create this colection to help the community.
